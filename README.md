# RoboMatrix C++ Engineering Bootcamp

A structured, project-based C++ training program focused on problem solving, engineering thinking, and real-world development practices.

This bootcamp is designed for students who want to learn programming seriously through implementation, structured challenges, and practical projects.

---

## 🎯 Program Goals

- Build strong C++ fundamentals through hands-on practice
- Develop analytical and structured problem solving skills
- Teach clean coding and modular program design
- Introduce real developer workflows using Git & GitHub
- Prepare students for advanced technical paths and competitions

---

## 🧠 Teaching Approach

This is not a lecture-heavy course.

Students will:

- Complete weekly engineering missions
- Work on practical mini-projects
- Learn through implementation instead of memorization
- Practice real development workflows
- Improve debugging and logical thinking skills
